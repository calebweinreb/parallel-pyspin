# parallel-pyspin #
This package provides another layer of abstraction on top of the Python wrapper for FLIR's [Spinnaker Software Development Kit](https://www.flir.com/products/spinnaker-sdk/)(SDK). This new layer of abstraction provides these additional features:

1. parallel operation of cameras via the [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html) package
2. encapsulation of the procedure for configuring multiple cameras for synchronous video acquisition

For documentation of the installation procedure and basic usage please refer to the repository's [wiki](https://github.com/jbhunt/parallel-pyspin/wiki). For questions or general correspondence please send an email to hunt.brian.joshua@gmail.com.
